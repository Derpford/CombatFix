CombatFix
Making Minecraft's combat less horrible.

This mod adds two big things:
One, it makes attacks have a cooldown of roughly 1/2 second (10 ticks).
Two, it causes blocks to stop all damage and knock back the attacker if you block within 10 ticks of the attack connecting.
The goal of all this is to make combat rely less on click speed/gear and more on timing, blocking, and maneuvering.

Following the 1.8 combat update this mod is kind of unnecessary. I never got it working quite like I wanted it, anyway. 
This is now ARCHIVED. You may fork it if you feel like it.
